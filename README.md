## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^4.8.0 || ^5.7.0 || ^6.2.2 || >=8.0.0 is installed, and `npm` or `yarn` are available on the PATH environment variable.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.21.0 or greater is installed, and is available on the PATH environment variable.

## Quick Start

1- Open your terminal and clone the repository on your disk

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/IberaSoft/portafolio.git
```

2- Install all dependencies

```
yarn i
```

### Usage

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
yarn test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```
yarn run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minifier and the filenames include the hashes.
